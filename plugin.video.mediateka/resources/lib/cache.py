# cache.py – JSON files in the add-on profile folder: safe read/write helpers and an expiring cache.
#
# What it is for
#	Every plugin call starts from nothing, so anything worth keeping (the search history in
#	plugin.py, website responses that are slow to fetch, such as the 1 MB show index) is stored as
#	JSON files. The cache keeps API responses in profile/cache/ for a while, which makes going
#	back and forth in Kodi's menus fast and spares the website's servers.
#
# Why the writes look complicated
#	Kodi can run several plugin calls at the same time (a listing, a context-menu action,
#	playback), and they share these files. A reader must never
#	see a half-written file, and two writers must never mix their data. So every write goes to
#	its own temp file (named after the process and thread) and then replaces the real file in
#	one step with os.replace, which is atomic. Readers see either the old or the new file.
#
# Nothing here imports Kodi, so the tests can use it directly.
